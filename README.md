# Discord Bot Framework (DBF)

A basic Discord bot framework to allow for easier creation of bots. With this library, you can easily parse and handle commands, slash commands, events, buttons, and select menus. You can also have the bot's status change at a set interval, which can be useful for showing more information in the status.

All the functions and variables have been documented in [the script](dbf.js).

We hope you find this library useful!
